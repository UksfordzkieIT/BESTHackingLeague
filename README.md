This web app provides automatic gas station prices comparison based on users location and can help to navigate to the most economical station, as well as tools for water, public transportation and fuel bills management.

We used API's to gain information about user's location, distance to gas station and to show route from user to chosen station.

**API's:**

* HTML5 Geolocation API - User's location

* geoapify - Geocode and Reverse Geocode

* openrouteservice - Route distance to gas station

* Google Directions API - Displaying route in new browser window
