This web app provides automatic gas station prices comparison based on users location and can help to navigate to the most economical station, as well as tools for water, public transportation and fuel bills management.

We used API's to gain information about user's location, distance to gas station and showing route.

API's:

HTML5 Geolocation API - User's location

geoapify - Geocode and Reverse Geocode

openrouteservice - Route distance to gas station
